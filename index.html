                        evolution, from his beginning of time and up to this point, these are like specks of dust of the
                        universal wisdom in comparison to what man will enjoy from the knowledge which is to be revealed
                        in

                        new
                        knowledge man will become close to realise how much more he needs to discover and learn about

                        Universe.</p>
                    <p>In these series of disclosures, the world of science will be opened into realisation of
                        the real working of the Universe and how man can advance his intelligence...and that this new,
                        up to
                        now unknown science, can clear the way for bringing Peace to man's own wondering life and other

                        <p>In July 2009 a new book, titled <b>"The Universal Order of Creation of Matters"</b> written
                            by
                            nuclear engineer MT Keshe, is published. One of the topics discussed in this book is that
                            how
                            Matter, Antimatter and Dark Matter are created in the Universe. What scientists at present
                            call
                            elementary particles (like quarks and so on) are themselves in fact collections of smaller
                            magnetic fields, which in group as dynamic plasmatic magnetic fields and their interactions
                            with
                            other dynamic plasmatic magnetic fields, lead to creation of quarks and so forth.
                            Where in fact, what is called the mass of the quark, this in reality is created through the
                            same method as the mass of any other object in the Universe and is purely due to the
                            interaction
                            of constituent <b>plasmatic magnetic fields within the center of the Matter</b>.
                            Through tests done, where separation of these Matters of plasma in reactors was achieved,
                            and,
                            by using the effects of the interaction of plasmatic magnetic fields of Antimatters within
                            the
                            cores of reactors, forces of magnitudes were created which are unknown in today's world of
                            physics and industry.

                        <p> As we are helping with series of books which have been published and are to be released, to
                            build the full knowledge of the structure of the operation of the magnetic fields and their
                            interactions in the world of creation for man to understand the entire process, one comes to
                            the
                            point that one has to explain different proportions of this entity in different levels of
                            creation of the greater Universe and not the man’s Universe. In the first book the "<em>The
                                Creation of Matters</em>", the operation and interaction of smaller fields, which lead
                            to
                            creation of matters was explained.<br>
                            In the second book we merely explained the method of travel of the collection of fields in
                            the
                            form of so called light. In this third book, further expenation of the operation and
                            interaction of bigger cells of the same fields, which then leads to the creation of the
                            man's
                            Universe and more, and what is too much for man to understand with his present scientific
                            knowledge, and he calls it <b>the Universe</b>.</p>

                    This covers all aspects of operation, design and control of such reactors.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Seed of the Earth</h3>
                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper:<b>The theory that the heat of the core of the Earth</b>
                    is due to inertia of the material pilled on top of each other is completely dismissed through
                    this new disclosure.The author believes that this centre core is made of hydrogen, other gases
                    and a mixture of liquid and solid Matters which were in the vicinity of the centre of the core
                    of the Earth at the time of its inception in the Solar system.Through this new understanding of
                    the new inner cores of the planet, this brings to play the fact that the old inner core of the
                    Earth that is already assumed to be made of a solid piece,itself becomes a sealed container for
                    the new inner core.The author through design of a parallel system has set to confirm the validity
                    of this assumption, that the centre of the Earth possesses a semi-fusion atomic reactor and not a
                    fission reactor as has been assumed by other scientists. <br>
                    This theory of hydrogen in the centre of the planet is in line with the physical reality of
                    the creation and the present situation in the physical construction of the Solar system.
                    By the laws of physics all the gases in the Solar system should have been in the giant gas planets
                    at the outer layers of the solar system, like in Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
                    The physical reality in the Solar system, is that the lightest of all these
                    gasses, the Hydrogen, has taken its place right in the centre of the solar system in its star, the
                    Sun. It has to be recognised that the centre of all planets in possession of gravity due to the
                    centre cores heating, are always in possession of two Magnetic Field Forces in their inner sanctum.
                    In the case of the Earth up to now and with the present knowledge
                    there has been acceptance of only one inner core and one magnetic force. As it is explained in the
                    paper titled <i>"The creation of gravity"</i>, there is an inner core in the inner core. This inner
                    core, due to it physical content, motion and position in the centre of the Earth, creates and
                    maintains its own magnetic field force, independent of the magnetic force which has been known
                    to be created by the interaction of the inner core and the outer core of the planet.
                    These two magnetic fields interact to create the planet's own double magnetic fields in its centre.
                    The interaction of these two magnetic fields forces upon each other leads to the new concept
                    of the "<i>DOUBLE MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECT</i>", where the interaction between these two field
                    forces in the centre of the planet leads to the creation of the gravity and the magnetic forces
                    of the planet (Paper: The creation of gravity).<br>
                    This new second core is the seed core of the planet, the mother seed of the planet positioned in
                    this new inner core.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Creation of Black Hole</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper it is explained that the Black Hole is created out of a natural sequence of events,
                    and that the existence of the Black Hole in a galaxy is a normal event. <br>
                    Further it is explained that a Black hole is created in similar ways to the Dark Spots on the surfac
                    e of the Sun. In this paper for the first time, it is explained how the Black Hole is physically
                    created
                    and what function it plays in its galaxy.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Magnetosphere</h3>
                <p>
                    "<b>The shape and the strength of the magnetosphere of a planet is exactly what a fingerprint is to
                        a man."</b><br>
                    It is unique to each planet, star and galaxy. It is a tell tale of all its attributes, and it
                    reveals the hidden mysteries of the internal materials’ structure.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Correction to the Einstein equation of Relativity</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper the physical reality of the Einstein equation is considered, and efforts are made to
                    bring this equation to the real conditions. Even Einstein considers this equation applicable for
                    very
                    small mass, and not in real three dimensional multi-magnetic and gravitational conditions, which are
                    external and have nothing to do with the theoretical object's mass and speed, but have effect on the
                    speed
                    and the mass of the object under consideration.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Introduction to the New System</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper it is written "<b>It is essential to understand that, with the application of this
                        system

                        as is
                        used today</b>".<br>

                    Universe, like creation of gravity and magnetic field protection the same as the magnetospheric
                    protection condition of planets and motion through interaction of magnetic fields as planets and
                    stars do in their given environment.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Rings of Saturn</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the oldest puzzles in the world of astronomy has been the existence of the Rings around
                    Saturn.<br>
                    How did these rings come to exist the way they are now?<br>
                    How did they come to appear and behave the way they do?<br>
                    These questions and much more about the creation of these rings are all answered in
                    this paper.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Creation of Gravity</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper it is explained that "<b>the Source and the creator of the magnetic forces and the
                        gravitational forces are due to the interaction between the same materials in the same region of
                        the planet</b>."<br>
                    Further it is explained how the gravitational field force can be created, replicated and
                    controlled within a nuclear reactor. Further it is explained how this property can be used for
                    the motion of a system within a planetary or Solar system. <br>
                    Now by understanding the principal of the creation of gravity, in this paper it is further explained
                    that "<b>the gravity in reality is the effect of the interaction of two plasmatic magnetic energy
                        fields of any two object in respect to each other.</b>"

                <p>
                    In this paper the death of stars is explained, "<i>The death of a star and the creation of a
                        supernova is in reality the same as the half-life cycle energy step-down of an atom,
                        with the difference that this show is in a larger scale, and more spectacular, in all aspects
                        of its dimensions</i>".</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Fusion</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper the physical and scientific problems with present fusion technology is considered.
                    it is written, "<b>nuclear Scientists, with the fusion reactors of today, are trying to create
                        fusion in the opposite way to the known laws of physics and their parallels in the
                        Universe</b>”.
                    <br>Further in this paper it is written "<b>if the present path for creation of fusion is followed,
                        with the present scientific knowledge of physical materials for construction of such system,
                        then following the present path of development to create energy from current fusion systems
                        will be a distant dream</b>".

                    Some extracts from this paper: "<b>The reality of the transportation and transmutation of a cell is
                        from the reality of the life of an atom or a star, where the life cycle of the cells are
                        slightly more complicated, as they contain other Matters like acids, which have their own
                        magnetic characteristic of their on chemical structure. For this reason the control
                        and replication cell is very much complex, but very simple to achieve</b>".</p>

                <p>
                    The content of this paper explains how and where atoms in the Universe are originated from and
                    how the construction of atoms in a cold plasmatic nuclear reactor can be replicated.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Magnetism</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper it is written, "The question is where did the Magnetism come from? This is the
                    Secret
                    of

                    combination
                    and
                    interaction with its own different strength fields makes it appear as different Matter. The rest
                    of
                    creations are the outcome of these interactions of different strength of this thing called
                    magnetism
                    and
                    the forces it creates. Magnetism is the origin of existence and the real singularity in its full
                    meaning".</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The creation of the magneto-gravitational force</h3>
                <p>
                    The creation of magneto-gravitational field force is and will be fundamentally independent of
                    temperature and pressure, proviso to the fact that homogenous, free-floating PMF (<i>Plasmatic
                        Magnetic Fields</i>)within a Matter are created.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Core of the Earth</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the original assumptions in developing the new gravitational system some thirty years ago
                    was on the basis that the centre of the Earth possesses addition cores, which create the
                    necessary gravitational conditions of the planet. After some twenty years of space technology and
                    through Earthquake seismological data's this assumption has been shown to be correct and after over
                    twenty years, it has been scientifically proven that the inner core of the Earth has an inner core
                    of 600 km.
                    Professor Guy Master in 2002 ref 24 nuclear planet. The centre of this core is assumed to have
                    an inner core of 8 Km, this he thought to be made of the plutonium or other nuclear materials.
                    But the developer of this new plasma reactor technology has proven through physical dynamic cores
                    that these cores possess a mixture of hydrogen plasmas and the process of the heating of the centre
                    of the Earth are due to a semi-fusion chain of events.</p>

                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: "<i>The electron atomic welding or atomic welding principle is the
                        phenomenon that atoms of the same material, through a common shared electron, become a
                        magnetically balanced molecule of the same Matter, with the difference that the shared electron
                        will create a balanced PMF in the molecule</i>".</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Shutdown and safety of the reactor core</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper the safety parameters in the operation of the gravitational and energy reactors
                    are simply explained to avoid the loss of plasma and gravitational field forces created within
                    its cores.

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Reactor Start-up</h3>
                <p>
                    In this paper the systematic start-up of the dynamic reactors for the creation of gravitational
                    field forces and the production of energy are set out. The start up of these systems are totally
                    different then the prior arts known in the nuclear industry.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Energy Balance of the Reactor</h3>
                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: The energy balance of these types of reactors is not as simple as
                    might look in the first instance. The energy creation is simple. But the heat leakage and
                    dissipation through the deliberate inherent material design are and can be zero.<br>
                    That is to say the system not only can hold on the heat it creates.
                    At the same time due to the close circuit fed operation will become self-sufficient & long lasting.
                    In planets, the loss of heat through their surface creates the variation in the central core
                    condition over several billions of years. In this reactor,as losses can be literally negligible,
                    the system can operate at low energy loss temperatures. Even the boundary of the body could be
                    made through the right combination of material in the chambers, so that the body of the reactor
                    will be colder then its surrounding boundary. So the system will not only lose energy to its
                    surrounding, but it can be made to absorb heat in the negative temperature gradient from its
                    surrounding, so that there are no losses.

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">Nuclear Decay or Half-life</h3>
                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: "The nuclear decay always has the same or near the same time
                    duration.<br>
                    This is due to the fact that the all neutrons and protons, from their inception, carry a
                    predetermined level of plasmatic magnetic energy. This energy is continually used for the
                    motion and vibration of different elements of the nucleus in respect to each other and the
                    surrounding Matters of the atom.<br>
                    As the space and dimensions of a nucleus of an atom always obeys the same principal of the
                    magnetic separation and magnetic attraction. Protons or neutrons can and will need to use
                    or consume the same energy before they become weak enough that the splitting or decay
                    becomes a clockwork job. The nuclear decay is the natural levelling done of a nucleus’
                    energy, due to the energy consumption and heat dissipation for the motion of the elements
                    of the nucleus for its remaining plasmatic magnetic fields
                    energy necessarily needed for them to hold one together".</p>

                <p>
                    "<b>What this means is that, for example in trying to recycle the CO2, by the use of the right

                        in the form of pure water, and C in the form of atomic or molecular carbon, or even by
                        feeding this back through certain operational compressions and gravitational interactions

                    The use of the reactor for this purpose has been proven to be correct and Raman spectroscopy
                    has proven the concept and physical reality of the separation of Matter in atomic level,

                    a fundamental effect on the behaviour of the structure and properties of the Matter which is created
                    in either way".<br>
                    This is explained and utilised to develop a new method in creating graphene and Sp3 atoms

                    Some extracts from this paper: The design of the side open system for lunch of high saturation
                    magnetic plasma package is one of the most effective technologies for defence of the reactor and the
                    craft which is in possession of such a system. <br>
                    It is essential for any space technology in the open environment of the Universe, if the craft is
                    to keep a straight line of motion and to be able to protect itself from
                    any solids or Matters in its path in the cosmos. <br>
                    This technology can destroy any object by the principal of plasmatic magnetic energy saturation
                    of the incoming object at a molecular level, that object will disintegrate in the form of magnetic
                    vapour and not atomic level destruction, before Matter can damage the craft as debris,
                    and before the craft ever becomes in touch or near these space Matters.<br>
                    This technology can also be used to protect Earth from the collision risk of NEO's (Near Earth
                    Objects), like comets and asteroids.</p>

                <p>
                    The manufacture of an atom of any density, this being of the simplest form of nucleus or a full
                    atom of hydrogen, or even heavier elements in the Universe, all follow the same principal.<br>
                    Atoms are created in the soup of the Cosmos from collections of very weak plasmatic magnetic
                    fields, which for their existence cluster and share their energies with the magnetic fields
                    that are not far from their own plasmatic magnetic field strength.</p>

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Relationship between Gravity and Mass</h3>
                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: "<b>A planet like Earth possesses a combination of both gravity
                        and inertia</b>.<br>
                    Where the gravity comes from the interaction of plasmatic magnetic energy fields from the
                    processes within its core, and the inertia comes purely from the collection molecules PMF of
                    Matters which has built the physical body of the planet. Any object, being an electron, atom,
                    molecule or even a human body, is a collection of plasmatic magnetic energy fields of different
                    strengths and their interactions between each other, which in total decides the total or
                    collective magnetic field possessed by that object where this is the mass of the object.
                    Where the mass of an object is a collective package of plasmatic magnetic energy field
                    tightness of a given object and will not change as long as the object is intact as one entity
                    in its overall atomic or molecular or collective molecular appearance.<br>
                    Plasmatic magnetic energy of a physical body ( so called the mass of the body) in interaction
                    with molecular or atomic magnetic field ( this being gravitational or inertia) of another object,
                    will determine the weight of the two object in respect to each other in each others environment".

                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: <b>The existence of Dark Matter is not questionable</b>.
                    Proving its existence, and its effect on the energy balance of the Universe, in all Matters
                    as small as in the heart of an electron or in a solar system needs to be created,
                    replicated and its effect measured. <br>
                    The theory of Dark Matter does not and needs not to be considered as complicated, if one understands
                    in real terms the plasmatic magnetic energy of the Matter in the visible and invisible dimensions
                    of the universal work.<br>
                    The Dark Matter has two distinctive characteristics, which makes it totally apart from the
                    visible Matter. The Dark Matter possess mass but not visible light, where its existence can only be
                    determined by the weight of the its hidden mass, which could be substantial due to its internal

                <h3 class="unpublished__header">The Inter-Atomic Fusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Some extracts from this paper: "The fusion of two or more atoms has been the pre-occupation of
                    nuclear physicists for past years. Conditions to achieve fusion of two hydrogen plasmas in the
                    <i>TOKAMAK</i> reactors have taken years to teach scientists a lot about the behaviour of plasma
                    and their fusing.<br>
                    The reality about the fusion in someway has to be reconsidered as, if the scientific world is trying
                    to amalgamate the contents of two plasmas to release energy. There must be a simpler way to achieve
                    releases of similar energies. <br>
                    The fundamental principal of the <i>Inter-atomic Fusion</i> is a much simpler way to
                    achieve fusion. If this principal is applied to the atomic condition of fusion, then fusion will be
                    attained in a simple but in a much more physically realistic environment. The explanation for the
                    inter- atomic fusion is very simple and direct. In the fusion of two plasma of proton of hydrogen
                    atom, the physicists try to fuse two large plasmas, and by doing so, they try to release a large
                    amount of energy.
                    Where in this process enormous amount of magnetic field forces and currents are needed to bring two
                    plasma in close proximity, so that the energy barriers in between them can be overcome for them to
                    amalgamate or fuse. In the <i>Inter-atomic Fusion</i> the overcoming of energy barriers does not
                    exist, as in this method of fusion, the electron of the atom which is circulating the nucleus of
                    the atom and is of the same origin, will be encouraged to return into and fuse with the nucleus of
                    its atom". <br>
                    Where this is a more practical way to create and release manageable energies and there is no need
                    for elaborate systems where even if the energy release will be small compared to dreamed up fusion
                    systems of today.<br>
                    With <i>Inter-atomic Fusion</i> method at least small and practical systems can be developed to
                    handle low temperatures of the fusion process.

                    can be reached at room temperature and at atmospheric conditions.<br>
                    We have now indications - through static and dynamic tests in reactors - that the Universe
                    was made in normal condition, which was originally nothing but packages of plasmatic magnetic fields
                    of different strengths, which were themselves nothing but areas of plasma or collections of loose
                    magnetic fields energies. Where magnetic fields of different strength in locking to
                    each other, by the principle of their plasmatic magnetic energy (PME), have caused in the first
